      <description>This GitHub repository is a Data Science Project attempting to predict Heart Failure among patients. Heart failure is a progressive condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body’s oxygen demand. Cardiovascular disease causes 17.9 million deaths per year, making it the leading cause of death globally. Additionally, heart disease cost the United States $363 billion in 2016 due to health care services, medicine, and lost productivity.</description>

      <description>Numerical methods are techniques used to solve mathematical problems using numerical approximations and algorithms. These methods are essential for solving problems that cannot be solved analytically or symbolically. Here are some of the most common numerical methods that are demonstrated in my GitHub:
Root-finding methods: These are methods used to find the roots of an equation or function. Some of the common methods include the bisection method, Newton-Raphson method, and the secant method.</description>

      <description>We are delighted to be able to inform the reader, that during the whole of this scene, Gringoire and his piece had stood firm. His actors, spurred on by him, had not ceased to spout his comedy, and he had not ceased to listen to it. He had made up his mind about the tumult, and was determined to proceed to the end, not giving up the hope of a return of attention on the part of the public.</description>

      <description>In the twinkling of an eye, all was ready to execute Coppenole’s idea. Bourgeois, scholars and law clerks all set to work. The little chapel situated opposite the marble table was selected for the scene of the grinning match. A pane broken in the pretty rose window above the door, left free a circle of stone through which it was agreed that the competitors should thrust their heads. In order to reach it, it was only necessary to mount upon a couple of hogsheads, which had been produced from I know not where, and perched one upon the other, after a fashion.</description>

      <description>While the pensioner of Ghent and his eminence were exchanging very low bows and a few words in voices still lower, a man of lofty stature, with a large face and broad shoulders, presented himself, in order to enter abreast with Guillaume Rym; one would have pronounced him a bull-dog by the side of a fox.

      <description>Poor Gringoire! the din of all the great double petards of the Saint-Jean, the discharge of twenty arquebuses on supports, the detonation of that famous serpentine of the Tower of Billy, which, during the siege of Paris, on Sunday, the twenty-sixth of September, 1465, killed seven Burgundians at one blow, the explosion of all the powder stored at the gate of the Temple, would have rent his ears less rudely at that solemn and dramatic moment, than these few words, which fell from the lips of the usher, “His eminence, Monseigneur the Cardinal de Bourbon.</description>
