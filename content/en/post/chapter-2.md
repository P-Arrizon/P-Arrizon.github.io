This [GitHub](https://github.com/P-Arrizon/SDS322E_Project.github.io) repository is a Data Science Project attempting to predict Heart Failure among patients. Heart failure is a progressive condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body’s oxygen demand. Cardiovascular disease causes 17.9 million deaths per year, making it the leading cause of death globally. Additionally, heart disease cost the United States $363 billion in 2016 due to health care services, medicine, and lost productivity. The motivation behind this project is to improve the accuracy of heart diagnoses. Statistical models can bring a lot of value to the field of health care, and cardiology specifically. Their use could allow health professionals to more accurately select which health factors to prioritize when diagnosing patients. By understanding the impact that various biological markers have on an individual’s likelihood of developing heart failure, preventative measures can be more effective.
