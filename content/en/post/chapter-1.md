**Numerical methods** are techniques used to solve mathematical problems using numerical approximations and algorithms. These methods are essential for solving problems that cannot be solved analytically or symbolically. Here are some of the most common numerical methods that are demonstrated in my [GitHub](https://github.com/P-Arrizon/Numerical_Methods):

1. **Root-finding methods**: These are methods used to find the roots of an equation or function. Some of the common methods include the bisection method, Newton-Raphson method, and the secant method.

2. **Numerical integration methods**: These methods are used to approximate the integral of a function. Some of the common methods include the trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule, and Gauss-Legendre quadrature.

3. **Ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers**: These methods are used to solve ODEs numerically. Some of the common methods include Euler's method, Runge-Kutta methods, and multi-step methods.

Numerical methods are used in various fields such as engineering, physics, economics, and computer science to solve complex problems. It is important to choose the appropriate numerical method for a particular problem, and to understand the limitations and sources of errors in these methods.
